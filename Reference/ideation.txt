Perfect. This just became even more serious.

You’re not building a club site anymore.
You’re building a digital governance + innovation platform for IT Club of CCT.

Below is your final master documentation text — structured, complete, and ready to save as .txt.

14. API DESIGN FOR FUTURE MOBILE APP

API Base: /api/v1/

Authentication:

Token-based (Laravel Sanctum)

Example Endpoints:

POST /api/v1/login
GET /api/v1/events
GET /api/v1/tutorials
POST /api/v1/vote
GET /api/v1/finance/summary
POST /api/v1/code/execute

API Response Format:

{
"status": true,
"message": "Success",
"data": {}
}

Because APIs are built from the beginning, future mobile app development (Flutter or React Native) will require no backend rewrite.
